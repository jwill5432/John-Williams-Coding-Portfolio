                My name is John Williams, and I am an Environmental Scientist learning computer science. I graduated from Rutgers with a degree in Environmental Science in 2021, and I am currently taking a computer Science bootcamp to broaden my scientific Horizons.

            <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>
                    These are the projects that I have completed during my time as a web developer. They were created and refined using the techniques that I learned inside and outside the classroom.

             This project was created in order to have a place to save notes and ideas from the aspects of computer science that we learned in the prework for my computer science bootcamp. As I learn more and continue to update it, its is the perfect place to store and review coding information.

            <p>
            I updated the code and the css on this website to provide a better user experience and fix any bugs that were present in the interface. This was a phenomenal way to learn and review css methods for improving the readability and functionality of a website.

I was part of the team that created RunnerUp, an exercise website that store's the workoput infornation and duration to help users track their execise durations over a long period of time.

             <p>
Devlist was a project by myself and my classmates in which we created a website for our specific bootcamp segment to put our portfolios up on display on a website that could be used to show potential employers.
